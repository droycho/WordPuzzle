## Description

_{This is a very simple and basic Java web program designed to demonstrate understanding of Java development using BDD. A couple other focuses are in spec testing, integration testing, and proper separation of interface and business logic. the program is designed to take a user's input and return the input without any vowels, with the exception of the vowel "y". The user can then send the output (which is the same as their input, minus the vowels mentioned above) to someone to solve the puzzle. Additional features, such as having the second user guess the original meaning from results page, will come soon.}_
